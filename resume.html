            An accomplished data science student with a Bachelor's degree
            in science, having strong mathematical and analytical skills. My
            technical expertise includes Python programming, SQL databases, data
            visualization, data manipulation, statistics, and storytelling. I
            have applied these skills in various projects, such as Sales
            Analysis with Tableau, Data Visualization with Power BI on COVID-19,
            Exploratory Data Analysis project on human resources, Bike Demand
            Visualization Project, and Data visualization projects on crypto and
            stocks. Through these experiences, I have honed my ability to
            extract, analyze, and effectively present data. With a comprehensive
            understanding of statistics, I possess the proficiency to derive
            valuable insights and effectively communicate them to diverse
            audiences. Overall, I am a versatile and adept data science
            professional, fully equipped to tackle real-world data challenges.

            As a mathematics teacher, I had the opportunity to teach high school
            students statistics and probabilities, helping them develop a strong
            understanding of these mathematical concepts. It was rewarding to
            witness their progress and see them gain confidence in applying
            statistics and probabilities in real-life scenarios.

            I pursued a Bachelor of Science degree with a specialization in
            Physics, complemented by subjects in Mathematics, Electronics and
            Programming. This interdisciplinary approach allowed me to develop a
            well-rounded understanding of the core principles in physics, while
            also honing my mathematical and programming skills. By combining
            these areas of study, I gained a comprehensive foundation that
            enables me to approach complex scientific problems with analytical
            thinking and computational tools.

            Throughout my journey, I have gained extensive knowledge and skills
            in data science. I have studied programming languages such as Python
            and SQL, along with libraries like NumPy and Pandas for efficient
            data manipulation. My expertise in data visualization extends to
            tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, as well as Tableau and
            Power BI. With a strong foundation in statistics and storytelling
            abilities, I am capable of deriving meaningful insights from data
            and effectively communicating them. Additionally, I have practical
            experience with Google Sheets and a basic understanding of HTML and
            CSS, further enhancing my capabilities in data analysis and
            web-related projects.
